# url-shortener-aakash
A simple Web Application to shorten the long URLs.

A URL shortener is a basic web application that helps us to take longer URLs as an input and provide short links as it's output. In this project, I have built a basic url shortener which takes a long url as it's input and provides a short link of less than 20 characters as the output. The input url and the output link is maintained in a table along with a count of the number of times that shortened link is opened. All of these features are included on the same page and give the output on the same webpage as well.
